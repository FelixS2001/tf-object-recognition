# Image recognition with TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine
A small web app which detects objects in images via the webcam.

## Getting Started
1. Open your command line and clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/FelixS2001/tf-object-recognition.git`
2. Open `https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image` in your browser and start training your model (there is a description on how to do that)
3. Download your trained model and unpack the zip file in the `tf-object-recognition` directory (or elsewhere on your machine)
4. Open the `app.html` file in the browser (no web server is needed for that)
5. Select the corresponding `model.json`, `weights.bin` and `metadata.json` files
6. Start the app (and be sure you grant access to your webcam) ðŸ˜„
